# Single-Degree-of-Freedom Experiments Demonstrating Electromagnetic Formation Flying for Small Satellite Swarms Using Piecewise-Sinusoidal Controls

This project is dedicated for Electromagnetic Actuation and Pulse Sensing in Single Degree of Freedom. The program written in this repository is for Experiment Setup that was built by [Ajin Sunny](https://github.com/ajinsunny). The program was originally written by [Ajin Sunny](https://github.com/ajinsunny). The program is last uploaded on 10-04-2019. Future commits to this program will be available on github.
